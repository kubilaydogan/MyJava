Functional Interface is an interface that defines a single abstract function(method)

If an interface has many abstract methods, the concrete class must implement all
abstract methods even it does not need them all. In this case functional interface
can be a solution.

For no "unwanted baggage" use Functional Interface.


@FunctionalInterface  is optional. Used to make sure we have only 1 abstract method
